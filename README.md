A tool designed to help college students with their reading assignments by providing AI-generated summaries, quizzes, and insights. Users can upload a file (e.g., a book chapter or an article) and receive a summary, key insights, and quizzes to test comprehension, all generated by an AI chatbot. The output is available in both text and audio formats for added convenience.

## Description

This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to interact with an AI chatbot that generates summaries and provides information from uploaded files. The chatbot is designed to be conversational, allowing for ongoing dialogue and contextual memory. Web scraping is also considered as an optional feature to locate source material for users without a file on hand.

**Target Audience**: College students who need an efficient way to process lengthy reading assignments.

## Goals

1. Make reading assignments more manageable for students.
2. Offer quizzes to help students assess their understanding of the material.
3. Provide both text and audio summaries, allowing students to listen to key points.
4. Build a conversational AI chatbot that remembers context and continues the conversation.
5. Gain hands-on experience in agile development and create a working application.

## Features
